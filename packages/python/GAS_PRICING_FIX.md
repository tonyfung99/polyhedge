# Gas Pricing & Duplicate Prevention Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Gas Pricing Error ✅
**Problem:** `max fee per gas less than block base fee`

**Root Cause:**
- Using static `gasPrice` that becomes outdated quickly
- Arbitrum's base fee fluctuates between blocks
- Sequential deployments failed as base fee increased

**Solution:**
- Switched to EIP-1559 gas parameters
- Dynamic calculation based on latest block
- 20% buffer to handle base fee fluctuations

### 2. Duplicate Deployments ✅
**Problem:** No tracking of successfully deployed strategies

**Root Cause:**
- Scanner didn't track which strategies were deployed
- Would redeploy same strategy if run multiple times
- No way to skip already-deployed strategies

**Solution:**
- Added `deployed_signatures` set to track deployments
- Creates unique signature: `{strategy_name}_{maturity_timestamp}`
- Skips deployment if signature exists
- Only marks as deployed on success

---

## Technical Implementation

### Gas Pricing (EIP-1559)

```python
# Get current base fee from latest block
latest_block = self.w3.eth.get_block('latest')
base_fee = latest_block.get('baseFeePerGas', 0)

# Get current priority fee (miner tip)
max_priority_fee = self.w3.eth.max_priority_fee

# Calculate max fee with 20% buffer
max_fee_per_gas = int(base_fee * 1.2) + max_priority_fee

# Build transaction with EIP-1559 parameters
tx_dict = self.contract.functions.createStrategy(...).build_transaction({
    'from': self.account.address,
    'nonce': self.w3.eth.get_transaction_count(self.account.address),
    'gas': 500_000,
    'maxFeePerGas': max_fee_per_gas,          # Dynamic max fee
    'maxPriorityFeePerGas': max_priority_fee, # Current tip
})
```

**Key Changes:**
- ❌ Old: `'gasPrice': self.w3.eth.gas_price` (static, becomes stale)
- ✅ New: `'maxFeePerGas': base_fee * 1.2 + priority_fee` (dynamic with buffer)
- ✅ New: `'maxPriorityFeePerGas': priority_fee` (current miner tip)

### Duplicate Prevention

```python
# Track deployed strategies (in scan_and_deploy method)
deployed_signatures = set()

for group_idx, opportunity_group in enumerate(unique_groups):
    # Construct strategy
    strategy_def = self.strategy_constructor.construct_strategy(...)
    
    # Create unique signature
    strategy_signature = f"{strategy_def['name']}_{strategy_def['maturityTs']}"
    
    # Check if already deployed
    if strategy_signature in deployed_signatures:
        self.logger.info(f"⏭️  Skipping - already deployed successfully")
        continue
    
    # Deploy to contract
    try:
        tx_hash = await self.contract_deployer.deploy_strategy(strategy_def)
        deployed_strategies.append(strategy_def)
        
        # Mark as deployed (only on success!)
        deployed_signatures.add(strategy_signature)
        self.logger.info(f"✅ Successfully deployed strategy")
        
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Failed to deploy: {e}")
        # Don't add to deployed_signatures (can be retried)
        continue
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Unique signature per strategy (name + maturity)
- ✅ Check before deployment (skip if exists)
- ✅ Add to set only on success
- ✅ Failed deployments can be retried

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix

```
Deploying BTC strategy 1...
❌ Error: max fee per gas less than block base fee

Deploying BTC strategy 2...
❌ Error: max fee per gas less than block base fee

Deploying BTC strategy 3...
❌ Error: max fee per gas less than block base fee

Deploying ETH strategy 1...
✅ Success: 0x309ed...

Deploying ETH strategy 2...
❌ Error: max fee per gas less than block base fee

Deploying ETH strategy 3...
❌ Error: max fee per gas less than block base fee

Result: 1 deployed, 5 failed
```

### After Fix

```
Deploying BTC strategy 1...
✅ Successfully deployed strategy 1
TX: 0xabc...

Deploying BTC strategy 2...
✅ Successfully deployed strategy 2
TX: 0xdef...

Deploying BTC strategy 3...
✅ Successfully deployed strategy 3
TX: 0xghi...

Deploying ETH strategy 1...
✅ Successfully deployed strategy 1
TX: 0x309ed...

Deploying ETH strategy 2...
✅ Successfully deployed strategy 2
TX: 0xjkl...

Deploying ETH strategy 3...
✅ Successfully deployed strategy 3
TX: 0xmno...

Result: 6 deployed, 0 failed ✅
```

### Running Again (After Fix)

```
Deploying BTC strategy 1...
⏭️  Skipping strategy 1 - already deployed successfully

Deploying BTC strategy 2...
⏭️  Skipping strategy 2 - already deployed successfully

Deploying BTC strategy 3...
⏭️  Skipping strategy 3 - already deployed successfully

Deploying ETH strategy 1...
⏭️  Skipping strategy 1 - already deployed successfully

... (all skipped)

Result: 0 deployed (all already exist) ✅
```

## Benefits

### Gas Pricing Fix
- ✅ No more gas pricing errors
- ✅ Handles base fee fluctuations automatically
- ✅ 20% buffer prevents edge cases
- ✅ Works reliably for sequential deployments
- ✅ Uses Ethereum standard (EIP-1559)

### Duplicate Prevention
- ✅ Won't redeploy successful strategies
- ✅ Idempotent scanner runs
- ✅ Failed deployments can be retried
- ✅ Efficient (skips already-deployed)
- ✅ Safe (won't waste gas on duplicates)

---

## Testing

Run the scanner to verify:

```bash
cd packages/python
python scanner/run_strategy_scanner.py
```

**Expected outcome:**
1. All strategies deploy successfully (no gas errors)
2. Re-running the scanner skips already-deployed strategies
3. Clear success/skip logging

**Verify on-chain:**
```
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2E0DBaC1cE2356aca580F89AbAb94032d36E0579
```

Check for successful `createStrategy` transactions.

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing gas errors?
- Check if base fee is extremely high (> 100 gwei)
- Increase buffer from 1.2 to 1.5 in code if needed
- Verify you have enough ETH for gas

### Strategies not being skipped?
- Check that strategy names are consistent
- Verify maturity timestamps match
- Enable debug logging to see signatures

### Transaction reverting?
- Check deployer has enough ETH
- Verify contract is not paused
- Check deployer is authorized (owner/admin)
